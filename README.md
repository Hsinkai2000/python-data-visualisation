# Realtime Excel Data Visualizer

This Python application allows users to visualize data from Excel files in real-time, with the ability to view, modify parameters, and observe maximum and minimum values in a gauge format. The application leverages data visualization techniques to provide an intuitive interface for data exploration and analysis.

## Features

1. **Real-time Data Visualization**: The application reads data from an Excel file and displays it in real-time using interactive visualizations.

2. **Excel Data Viewer**: Users can view the raw data directly from Excel within the application, facilitating data inspection and analysis.

3. **Parameter Modification**: Users can modify parameters within the application and observe the real-time effects on data visualization.

4. **Maximum and Minimum Gauge Display**: The application showcases maximum and minimum values of the dataset in a gauge format, providing a quick overview of data extremes.

5. **Interactive Visualizations**: The visualizations are interactive, allowing users to zoom, pan, and explore data dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for developing the application.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and handling Excel files.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: Utilized for generating interactive visualizations.
- **Dash**: Used for building interactive web-based visualization interfaces.
